## 1. Overview

Word Journey is a word-guessing puzzle game for Android. Your privacy matters. This policy describes what data the app collects, how it is used, and your rights as a user.

**Short version:** Word Journey stores all game data locally on your device. No personal information is collected, no data is sent to external servers, and no data is shared with third parties.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device

Word Journey stores the following information **only on your device** using Android's local storage (Room database and DataStore):

- **Game progress** — completed levels, best scores, combo streaks, unlocked content
- **Daily challenge history** — which daily challenges you have attempted and your results
- **In-game currency balances** — coins, diamonds, lives
- **Inventory items** — unlocked power-ups and consumable items
- **App preferences** — theme selection, sound/music settings, difficulty preferences, notification preferences
- **Timer mode records** — best times and high scores

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.

### 2.2 Data We Do NOT Collect

Word Journey does **not** collect, transmit, or store:

- Your name, email address, or any other contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers (IMEI, advertising ID, etc.)
- Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data
- Crash reports or diagnostics transmitted off-device
- Financial or payment information
- Any other personally identifiable information

---

## 3. Internet Permission

Word Journey requests the `INTERNET` permission to support the following planned features:

- **Google Play Games Services** — optional leaderboards and achievements (connection to Google servers; governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy))
- **Google Play Billing** — processing in-app purchases (coins, diamonds, lives, VIP subscription) through Google Play; governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/)

In the current version, these features use offline stubs. No internet requests are made by the app at this time. When live billing and Play Games integration are activated in a future update, this policy will be updated accordingly.

---

## 4. In-App Purchases

Word Journey offers optional in-app purchases (coins, diamonds, lives, bundled packs, and a VIP subscription) processed exclusively through **Google Play Billing**. We do not receive, store, or process your payment card information. All payment handling is performed by Google. Please review [Google Play's privacy practices](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

---

## 5. Notifications

If you grant notification permission, Word Journey may send you:

- **Daily challenge reminders** — a once-daily notification reminding you to play the daily challenge

You can disable notifications at any time in your device's system Settings → Apps → Word Journey → Notifications.

---

## 6. Permissions Summary

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `INTERNET` | Future Google Play Games / Billing integration |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Daily challenge reminder notifications |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Re-schedule daily reminder after device restart |
| `VIBRATE` | Haptic feedback during gameplay |

None of these permissions are used to collect or transmit personal information.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Word Journey does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The app does not require account creation and stores no personal data on external servers. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

---

## 8. Data Security

Because all game data is stored exclusively on your device, its security depends on your device's security settings (e.g., screen lock, device encryption). We recommend keeping your device's operating system and security settings up to date.

---

## 9. Data Retention and Deletion

All game data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all app data at any time via:

**Settings → Apps → Word Journey → Storage → Clear Data**

Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.

---

## 10. Third-Party Services

Word Journey does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs. The only third-party services planned for integration are Google services (Play Games, Play Billing), which are governed by their own privacy policies.

---

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app's features. The effective date at the top of this document will be updated accordingly. Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

---

## 12. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the [Word Journey GitHub repository](https://github.com/djtaylor333/word-journey/issues) or contact the developer directly through GitHub.
